# Walkthrough - XYZ College "Pratishtha Digital"

I have completed the implementation of the XYZ College educational portal. The site includes a premium landing page with all requested sections and a secure student dashboard.

## Features Implemented
- **Premium Visualization**: "Oxford Navy Blue" and Gold palette with glassmorphism effects.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout for all sections.
- **Sticky Header**: Navigation changes style on scroll.
- **Scroll Animations**: Sections fade in and lift up as you scroll.
- **Interactive Components**:
    - Sticky Header
    - Hover effects on cards
    - Auto-scrolling Feedback Carousel
- **Student Dashboard**: A separate, clean dashboard view for logged-in students.

## Verification Results

### 1. Landing Page ([index.html](file:///c:/pixellabs/xyz-college/index.html))
- **Hero Section**: Displays the AI-generated drone shot with a gradient overlay.
- **Trust Section**: 3 Glassmorphism cards are visible.
- **Timeline**: Vertical line connects dates, styles match the design.
- **Student Directory**: Displays student profiles with hover lift effect.
- **Principal Section**: Split screen layout with AI-generated portrait.
- **Feedback**: Infinite scrolling carousel is working.

### 2. Student Dashboard ([dashboard.html](file:///c:/pixellabs/xyz-college/dashboard.html))
- Accessed via the "Student Portal Login" button in the header.
- Shows Sidebar, Overview Stats, and Profile.
- Uses the same design system variables for consistency.

## How to Verify
1. Open [c:/pixellabs/xyz-college/index.html](file:///c:/pixellabs/xyz-college/index.html) in your browser.
2. Scroll down to see the header change and elements fade in.
3. Click "Student Portal Login" to view the dashboard.
4. Resize the browser window to test responsiveness.

## Generated Assets
I used AI to generate high-fidelity placeholders:
- `hero.png`: Campus drone shot.
- `principal.png`: Principal's portrait.
- `students.png`: Student group photo.
