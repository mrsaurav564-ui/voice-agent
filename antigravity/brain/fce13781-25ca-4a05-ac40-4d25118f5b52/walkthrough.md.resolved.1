# Walkthrough - XYZ College "Pratishtha Digital"

I have completed the implementation of the XYZ College educational portal. The site includes a premium landing page with all requested sections and a secure student dashboard.

## Features Implemented
- **Premium Visualization**: "Oxford Navy Blue" and Gold palette with glassmorphism effects.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout for all sections.
- **Sticky Header**: Navigation changes style on scroll.
- **Scroll Animations**: Sections fade in and lift up as you scroll.
- **Interactive Components**:
    - Sticky Header
    - Hover effects on cards
    - Auto-scrolling Feedback Carousel
- **Student Dashboard**: A separate, clean dashboard view for logged-in students.
    - **Results Page**: View academic performance and grades.
    - **Profile Page**: Manage personal and contact information.

## Verification Results
