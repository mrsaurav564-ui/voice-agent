# Login Pages Split Walkthrough

I have split the login functionality into separate HTML files as requested. Each file is optimized for a specific user role and automatically opens the login modal.

## Changes

### New Files Created

| File | Role | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [loginc.html](file:///d:/xampp/htdocs/Hackathon/backend/loginc.html) | **Citizen** | Auto-opens Citizen login. Landing page content removed. |
| [logins.html](file:///d:/xampp/htdocs/Hackathon/backend/logins.html) | **Federal** | Auto-opens Federal (State) login. Landing page content removed. |
| [loginp.html](file:///d:/xampp/htdocs/Hackathon/backend/loginp.html) | **Province** | Auto-opens Provincial login. Landing page content removed. |
| [loginl.html](file:///d:/xampp/htdocs/Hackathon/backend/loginl.html) | **Local** | Auto-opens Local login. Landing page content removed. |

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- **Citizen Login**: Opening [loginc.html](file:///d:/xampp/htdocs/Hackathon/backend/loginc.html) automatically shows the auth modal with the "Citizen" role selected. The close button is hidden to keep the user focused.
- **Federal Login**: Opening [logins.html](file:///d:/xampp/htdocs/Hackathon/backend/logins.html) automatically shows the auth modal with the "Federal" role selected.
- **Province Login**: Opening [loginp.html](file:///d:/xampp/htdocs/Hackathon/backend/loginp.html) automatically shows the auth modal with the "Province" role selected.
- **Local Login**: Opening [loginl.html](file:///d:/xampp/htdocs/Hackathon/backend/loginl.html) automatically shows the auth modal with the "Local" role selected.

### Code Verification
- Verified that the landing page sections (Hero, Services, etc.) were successfully removed from the new files.
- Verified that the auto-login script was correctly injected at the end of the `<body>` tag.

## Next Steps
- You can now link to these specific pages from your main application or distribute the URLs to the respective users.
