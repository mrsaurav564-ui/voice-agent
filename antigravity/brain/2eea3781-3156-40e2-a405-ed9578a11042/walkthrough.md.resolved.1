# Amarsingh Secondary School Website - Frontend Walkthrough

## Overview
I have successfully implemented the Public Frontend and the Admin Dashboard UI for the Amarsingh Secondary School website.

## Completed Features

### 1. Public Frontend
- **Hero Page**: Modern design with animations and stats.
- **Information Sections**: About, Academic, Contact pages.

### 2. Admin Dashboard (UI Only)
- **Layout**: Sidebar navigation, Top header with user profile.
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly sidebar (Sheet component).
- **Dashboard Home**: Key metrics cards (Students, Staff, Revenue) and activity feed.
- **Staff Management**: Table view to list, filter, and manage school staff (Mock data used).

### 3. Technical Implementation
- **Components**: Shadcn UI (Sheet, Dropdown, Table, Avatar, etc.).
- **Icons**: Lucide React.
- **State**: React Hook Form for contact, local state for tables.

## Next Steps
- **Database**: Fix credentials to enable real data fetching.
- **Auth**: Enable login flow.
- **School Portal**: Build features for Teachers/Staff.

## Notes
- The admin dashboard is accessible at `/admin` (currently bypassing auth for dev, or requires manual URL navigation if middleware blocks it).
