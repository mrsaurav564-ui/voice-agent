# Amarsingh Secondary School Website - Frontend Walkthrough

## Overview
I have successfully implemented the Public Frontend for the Amarsingh Secondary School website. This includes the Hero page, About Us, Academic Programs, and Contact sections, featuring a sophisticated, modern design with animations and responsive layouts.

## Completed Features

### 1. Hero Page
- **Referenced Design**: Inspired by `sxc.edu.np` but modernized.
- **Components**:
    - **Dynamic Navbar**: Responsive navigation with dropdowns for "About" and "Academic".
    - **Hero Section**: Large typography, gradient text, and "Apply Now" call-to-action.
    - **Stats Section**: Key metrics (Years of Legacy, Students, Faculty).
    - **Feature Grid**: Highlights of Academic Excellence, Expert Faculty, and Holistic Development.

### 2. Information Sections
- **About Us**:
    - Detailed history of the school since 1957.
    - Principal's message with a placeholder for the image.
    - Mission & Vision cards.

    - Detailed cards for Science, Management, Law, and Humanities streams.
    - Lists key subjects for each stream.
- **Contact Us**:
    - Functional-looking contact form (React Hook Form + Zod).
    - School address, phone, and email details with icons.
    - Administration hours.

### 3. Technical Implementation

## Next Steps
- **Database Connection**: Resolve the PostgreSQL connection issue to enable the backend.
