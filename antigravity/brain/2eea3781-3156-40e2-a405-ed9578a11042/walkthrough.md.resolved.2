# Amarsingh Secondary School Website - Frontend Walkthrough

## Overview
I have successfully implemented the Public Frontend and the Admin Dashboard UI.
**Critical Build Fixes**: Resolved persistent compilation errors related to `react-hook-form` and `@hookform/resolvers` by implementing local resolvers and patching dependencies.

## Completed Features

### 1. Public Frontend
- **Hero Page**: Modern design with animations and stats.
- **Information Sections**: About, Academic, Contact pages.
- **Contact Form**: Functional UI using local Zod implementation.

### 2. Admin Dashboard (UI Available)
- **URL**: `/admin` (Auth temporarily bypassed for review)
- **Layout**: Responsive Sidebar + Header + UserNav.
- **Dashboard Home**: Analytics cards (Students, Staff, Revenue).
- **Staff Management**: `/admin/staff` - Table view for managing school staff.

### 3. Technical Implementation
- **Build System**: Fixed `Module not found` errors. Production build (`npm run build`) is now **PASSING**.
- **Components**: Shadcn UI (Sheet, Dropdown, Table, Avatar, Form, etc.).
- **Icons**: Lucide React.
- **Local Resolvers**: Custom implementation of [zodResolver](file:///c:/school/lib/resolvers.ts#3-36) to ensure stability.

## Next Steps
- **Database**: Connect PostgreSQL to enable real authentication and data.
- **School Dashboard**: Implement the staff portal (Phase 5).
