# PostgreSQL Migration Plan

The goal is to switch the application's database from SQLite to PostgreSQL as requested.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Database Credentials**: You will need to provide a valid PostgreSQL connection string in the [.env](file:///c:/cafe/.env) file. I will set a placeholder value, but you must update it with your actual credentials.

## Proposed Changes

### Configuration

#### [MODIFY] [schema.prisma](file:///c:/cafe/prisma/schema.prisma)
- Change `datasource` provider from `"sqlite"` to `"postgresql"`.

#### [MODIFY] [.env](file:///c:/cafe/.env)
- Update `DATABASE_URL` to a PostgreSQL connection string format: `postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public`

### Database Operations
- Delete `prisma/migrations` folder (since we are switching providers, old SQLite migrations won't work).
- Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name init_postgres` to initialize the new database.
- Run `npx prisma db seed` to repopulate the database.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Verification
- Migration command success.
- Seed command success.
- `npx prisma studio` (optional) or checking API endpoints to verify data exists.

### Manual Verification
- Start the app and verify the Menu Manager still loads categories and items.
