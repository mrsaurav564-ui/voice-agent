# Menu System Implementation Walkthrough

I have successfully implemented the database-backed menu system, reverted to SQLite, fixed the order persistence issue, and redesigned the home page.

## Changes

### Database & Backend
- **Prisma Migration**: Migrated `orders`, `requests`, and `reviews` API routes from a mock filesystem DB to the SQLite database via Prisma. This ensures data is correctly saved and visible in the dashboard.
- **Models**: Added [Order](file:///c:/cafe/src/lib/mock-db.ts#37-43), `ServiceRequest`, [Review](file:///c:/cafe/src/lib/mock-db.ts#71-77), [Category](file:///c:/cafe/src/components/menu-manager/menu-manager.tsx#9-14), and `MenuItem` models to [prisma/schema.prisma](file:///c:/cafe/prisma/schema.prisma).

### Frontend Redesign
- **Home Page**: Completely overhauled [src/app/page.tsx](file:///c:/cafe/src/app/page.tsx) with a modern, vibrant design featuring:
    - Glassmorphism effects on the header and cards.
    - Hero section with a slow-zoom animation.
    - Improved typography and color usage (Orange/Amber theme).
    - Smooth animations using `framer-motion`.
- **Global CSS**: Added custom animations (`slow-zoom`, `bounce-subtle`) and utility classes.

### Bug Fixes
- **Tailwind Error**: Resolved `CssSyntaxError` by installing `tailwindcss-animate`.
- **Order Flow**: verified that orders placed on the home page are now sent to the Prisma backend, which means they will appear on the dashboard.

## Verification Results

### Functionality
- **Home Page**: Accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
- **Dashboard**: Accessible at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`.
- **Data Persistence**: Orders, requests, and reviews are now saved to the SQLite database `dev.db`.

> The server is running. You may need to refresh the page to see the new design.
