# Menu System Implementation Walkthrough

I have successfully implemented the database-backed menu system, reverted to SQLite, fixed the order persistence issue, redesign the home page, and added a real-time notification system.

## Changes

### Notification System
- **Order Tracking**: Implemented client-side tracking of user orders using `useCartStore` with persistence (localStorage).
- **Notifications**: Created [OrderTracker](file:///c:/cafe/src/components/order-tracker.tsx#7-51) component that polls the server for changes in order status and triggers toast notifications.
- **UI Feedback**: Integrated `sonner` for beautiful, animated toast notifications when orders move to "Preparing" or "Served".

### Database & Backend
- **Prisma Migration**: Migrated `orders`, `requests`, and `reviews` API routes from a mock filesystem DB to the SQLite database via Prisma. This ensures data is correctly saved and visible in the dashboard.
- **Models**: Added [Order](file:///c:/cafe/src/lib/mock-db.ts#37-43), `ServiceRequest`, [Review](file:///c:/cafe/src/lib/mock-db.ts#71-77), [Category](file:///c:/cafe/src/components/menu-manager/menu-manager.tsx#9-14), and `MenuItem` models to [prisma/schema.prisma](file:///c:/cafe/prisma/schema.prisma).

### Frontend Redesign
- **Home Page**: Completely overhauled [src/app/page.tsx](file:///c:/cafe/src/app/page.tsx) with a modern, vibrant design featuring glassmorphism and animations.
- **Global CSS**: Added custom animations (`slow-zoom`, `bounce-subtle`) and utility classes.

## Verification Results

### Functionality
- **Notifications**: When you place an order, the system tracks it. If you (or the kitchen staff) update the status in the dashboard, a toast notification appears on the home page.
- **Data Persistence**: Orders are saved to `dev.db` via Prisma.
- **Home Page**: Accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
- **Dashboard**: Accessible at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`.

> [!NOTE]
> The server is running. Orders placed are now tracked and will send alerts on status updates.
