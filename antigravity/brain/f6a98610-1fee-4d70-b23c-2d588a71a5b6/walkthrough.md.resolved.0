# Menu System Implementation Walkthrough

I have successfully implemented the database-backed menu system.

## Changes

### Database
- Added [Category](file:///c:/cafe/src/components/menu-manager/menu-manager.tsx#9-14) and `MenuItem` models to [prisma/schema.prisma](file:///c:/cafe/prisma/schema.prisma).
- Configured seeding in [package.json](file:///c:/cafe/package.json) and ran initial seed.

### API
- Created `/api/categories` to fetch categories.
- Created `/api/menu` to fetch and create menu items.

### Frontend
- Updated [MenuManager](file:///c:/cafe/src/components/menu-manager/menu-manager.tsx#15-119) to fetch categories from the API.
- Updated form submission to POST data to `/api/menu`.

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
- Database migration and seeding were successful.
- Frontend compilation is successful.
