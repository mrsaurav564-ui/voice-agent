# Walkthrough - XYZ College Digital Transformation

I have successfully created the high-fidelity mobile prototype for XYZ College. The project focuses on "Radical Transparency" and an "Authentic Digital Vibe" tailored for the Nepali market.

## Project Structure
The project is located at `c:/pixellabs/xyz-college` and contains:
- **`index.html`**: The Homepage with the Hero section, Trust Signals, and "Vibe" section.
- **`programs.html`**: The Programs page with Tab separation, transparent fee blocks, and faculty details.
- **`student-life.html`**: The Student Life page with vertical/horizontal scroll interactions.
- **`styles.css`**: The central design system handling the mobile-first layout, typography, and colors.
- **`script.js`**: Logic for the Contact Modal and Navigation active states.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Mobile-First Design
- **480px Max-Width Container**: Simulating a mobile app experience on desktop browsers.
- **Sticky Navigation**: Bottom bar for thumb-friendly navigation.
- **Floating Action Button (FAB)**: Persistent access to the "Contact" modal.

### 2. Radical Transparency (Screen 1 & 2)
- **Trust Signals**: Horizontal scrollable stats on the homepage.
- **Fee Transparency**: Explicit "Total Semester Fee" blocks in program cards (`programs.html`).
- **Real Faculty Profiles**: "Meet Your Mentors" section with qualifications.

### 3. Authentic "Vibe" (Screen 3)
- **Testimonial Carousel**: Horizontal scroll snap for alumni stories.
- **Virtual Tour Teaser**: Large call-to-action for campus exploration.

### 4. Interactive Elements
- **Contact Modal**: Sliding bottom-sheet for "Book a Tour", "Request Callback", and "WhatsApp Chat".
- **Language Toggle**: Visual toggle in the header.

## How to Test
1. Open `c:/pixellabs/xyz-college/index.html` in your browser.
2. Use **Developer Tools (F12)** and toggle the **Device Toolbar** to simulate an iPhone 14/15 Pro (approx 393x852px).
3. Navigate through the bottom tabs and try the "Talk to Us" FAB.
