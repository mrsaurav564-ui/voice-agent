# Walkthrough - Cafe Ordering System

## Changes Made

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Initialized Next.js 14 (App Router) with Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Theming**: Implemented "Foody" theme with Warm Orange/Terracotta primary colors and Dark/Light mode support.
- **Components**: Built reusable Shadcn UI components: [Button](file:///c:/cafe/src/components/ui/button.tsx#35-40), [Card](file:///c:/cafe/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx#204-253), [Sheet](file:///c:/cafe/src/components/cart-sheet.tsx#21-118) (Cart), `Popover` (Service Menu).

### Features Implemented
1.  **Landing Page**:
    - Hero section with "Foody vibes".
    - Menu category filtering (Momo, Noodles, Drinks).
    - Grid display of menu items with prices and descriptions.
    - Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

2.  **Cart & Ordering**:
    - Functional "Add to Cart" button.
    - **Cart Sheet**: Slide-out cart displaying selected items, quantities, and total calculation.
    - Global state management using `Zustand`.

3.  **Service Request System**:
    - Floating Action Button to access service menu.
    - Options to "Call Waiter", "Request Water", or "Request Bill".

4.  **Database (Schema Only)**:
    - Designed Prisma schema for `MenuItem`, [Order](file:///c:/cafe/src/lib/mock-db.ts#6-14), [Review](file:///c:/cafe/src/lib/mock-db.ts#23-30).
    - Note: Database integration is mocked in Frontend due to local environment constraints, but schema is ready for deployment.

5.  **Owner/Staff Dashboard**:
    - Accessible at `/dashboard`.
    - Real-time (Polling) view of Active Orders.
    - Kanban-style board: Pending -> Preparing -> Served -> Paid.
    - Tabs for viewing **Service Requests** (Waiter/Water/Bill) and **Customer Reviews**.
    - Notification badges for new requests.
    - Optimistic UI updates for fast status changing.

## Technical Implementation
- **Mock Database**: Implemented a file-based JSON DB ([data/db.json](file:///c:/cafe/data/db.json)) to persist Orders, Requests, and Reviews locally.
- **API Routes**: Created Next.js API routes (`api/orders`, `api/requests`, `api/reviews`) to handle data.
- **Polling**: Implemented 5-second polling on the Dashboard to simulate real-time updates.

## Verified Results

### Automated Checks
- `npm run dev`: Server starts successfully on port 3000.
- `tsc`: TypeScript compilation passed.

### Manual Verification Required
1.  Open `http://localhost:3000` (Customer View).
2.  Open `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` (Kitchen/Owner View) in a separate tab or window.
3.  **Order Flow**: 
    - Add items to Cart -> Place Order (Customer).
    - Watch it appear in "Pending" on Dashboard (Owner).
    - Click "Start Cooking" -> "Mark Served" (Owner).
4.  **Service Request**:
    - Click "Call Waiter" FAB (Customer).
    - Check "Requests" tab on Dashboard (Owner).
5.  **Reviews**:
