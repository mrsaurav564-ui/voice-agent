# Walkthrough - Cafe Ordering System

## Changes Made

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Initialized Next.js 14 (App Router) with Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Theming**: Implemented "Foody" theme with Warm Orange/Terracotta primary colors and Dark/Light mode support.
- **Components**: Built reusable Shadcn UI components: [Button](file:///c:/cafe/src/components/ui/button.tsx#35-40), `Card`, [Sheet](file:///c:/cafe/src/components/cart-sheet.tsx#20-90) (Cart), `Popover` (Service Menu).

### Features Implemented
1.  **Landing Page**:
    - Hero section with "Foody vibes".
    - Menu category filtering (Momo, Noodles, Drinks).
    - Grid display of menu items with prices and descriptions.
    - Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

2.  **Cart & Ordering**:
    - Functional "Add to Cart" button.
    - **Cart Sheet**: Slide-out cart displaying selected items, quantities, and total calculation.
    - Global state management using `Zustand`.

3.  **Service Request System**:
    - Floating Action Button to access service menu.
    - Options to "Call Waiter", "Request Water", or "Request Bill".

4.  **Database (Schema Only)**:
    - Designed Prisma schema for `MenuItem`, `Order`, `Review`.
    - Note: Database integration is mocked in Frontend due to local environment constraints, but schema is ready for deployment.

## Verified Results

### Automated Checks
- `npm run dev`: Server starts successfully on port 3000.
- `tsc`: TypeScript compilation passed after fixing `next-themes` imports.

### Manual Verification Required
Due to system limitations with the automated browser, please verify the following manually:
1.  Open `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  Test adding items to the cart and viewing the Total.
3.  Test the "Call Waiter" floating button.
4.  Toggle Dark/Light mode.

## Next Steps
- Connect the Mock Frontend to the real Prisma/Database backend.
- Implement the "Owner Dashboard" to receive the Service Requests.
