# Fix Apache 404 Error - Instructions

## Problem
Your [register.html](file:///d:/xampp2/htdocs/uplodedFile/register.html) file is located at [D:\xampp2\htdocs\uplodedFile\register.html](file:///d:/xampp2/htdocs/uplodedFile/register.html), but Apache's DocumentRoot is configured to look at [C:\xampp2\htdocs](file:///d:/xampp2/htdocs). This causes a 404 error when trying to access the file.

## Solution: Update Apache Configuration

### Step 1: Stop Apache
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Click **Stop** next to Apache

### Step 2: Edit httpd.conf
1. Open the file: [D:\xampp2\apache\conf\httpd.conf](file:///xampp2/apache/conf/httpd.conf) in a text editor (run as Administrator)
2. Find this line (around line 354):
   ```apache
   DocumentRoot "C:/xampp2/htdocs"
   ```
3. Change it to:
   ```apache
   DocumentRoot "D:/xampp2/htdocs"
   ```
4. Find this line (a few lines below):
   ```apache
   <Directory "C:/xampp2/htdocs">
   ```
5. Change it to:
   ```apache
   <Directory "D:/xampp2/htdocs">
   ```
6. **Save the file**

### Step 3: Restart Apache
1. Go back to XAMPP Control Panel
2. Click **Start** next to Apache

### Step 4: Test
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost/uplodedFile/register.html
```

The page should now load successfully!

## Alternative Solution: Quick Test Without Changing Config

If you want to test without changing Apache config, you can access the file directly:

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080` (if you have a different port configured)
2. Or use the file path directly in browser: `file:///D:/xampp2/htdocs/uplodedFile/register.html`

**Note:** The file path method won't work with the PHP API calls, so updating Apache config is the proper solution.
